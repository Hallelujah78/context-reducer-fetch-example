# What is this?

This is a very simple working example that incorporates react-router-dom, useReducer, useContext and fetching data from an API. It uses a SharedLayout component and outlet from react-router-dom.

There is a notes.js file that includes some code from various forums and links to articles/blogs/discussions about useCallback, useReducer, useContext and React rendering behavior.

State is persisted through refreshes using local storage. There are two state variables in the context: pictures and search. Pictures is the JSON response from Lorem Picsum and search is a string that can be toggled from 'Google' to 'Bing'. The purpose of search is simply to show that the state is persistent when the user refreshes. The value of search is displayed in the Navbar component with a button that allows the user to toggle between Google and Bing.

The initial state for pictures is taken from local storage if it exists, or set to an empty array. The initial state for search is taken from local storage or set to 'Google'.

This can be reused by:

1. changing all occurrences of picture to products or whatever you require
2. removing search and associated reducer function
3. strip out the inline CSS
4. clean out context and search content from Navbar.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
